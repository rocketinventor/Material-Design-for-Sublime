Hi there,

Here are some simple instructions to get you going.
Copy and paste one of the following bits to your user preferences file.

Material Blue:
{
  "theme": "materialfunk (Material Blue).sublime-theme"
}

Material Grey:
{
  "theme": "materialfunk (Material Grey).sublime-theme"
}

Include an additional line for a light sidebar if you fancy:
{
  "materialfunk_sidebar_light": true
}

Restart Sublime Text to make sure all changes are applied.

Enjoy!
