# Materialfunk

Materialfunk is a minimalistic theme for Sublime Text, based off of Google's material design specifications. It's code is forked from ST-Spacefunk theme, which is based off of [kkga's](https://github.com/kkga/spacegray) Spacegray theme.

## Install via Package Control

Material Space is not yet ready for production.
When it is ready, you will be able to search for `Theme - Material Design` in [Sublime Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net).

## Setup

Materialfunk will have several color choices. The hope is to have as many as 9-15/18 of the official colour preferences available so that nearly all of the easily distinguishable material design colors can be used. You will be able to activate the theme by editing your user preferences.
Go to: `Preferences -> Settings - User`.

### Additional customization
If you prefer a lighter version of the sidebar you can add the following line to your preferences file. This will be available for most of the color choices of MaterialSpace.

```
{
  "material_sidebar_light": true
}
```
Restart Sublime Text to make sure all changes are applied. Enjoy!

#### Material design - Colour schemes
There are currently 2 color schemes that fit well with the theme.
They are part of the "material color scheme" package and will eventually be merged into this repository and some more color schemes will be added.
